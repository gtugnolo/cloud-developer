# cloud-developer
content for Udacity's cloud developer nanodegree

- I have modified the project code inside https://github.com/gtugnolo/cloud-developer/tree/master/course-02/project/image-filter-starter-code/src
- I have modified both server.ts and util.ts to catch errors on jimp since it throwed some errors when uploading SVGs as a test
- I have used both the master and dev branch as requested, finally merged into master and pushed to the repo
